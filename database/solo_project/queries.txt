	Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

SELECT * FROM teams;

id|name|city|roster_size|made_playoffs|league_id
1|Eagles|Philadelphia|90|false|2
2|Redskins|Washington|86|true|2
3|Bills|Buffalo|93|false|1
4|Patriots|New England|89|true|1
5|Giants|New York|91|false|2
6|Panthers|Charlotte|88|true|1


SELECT * FROM league;

id|conference
1|AFC
2|NFC



	Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

UPDATE league SET conference ="American Football Conference" Where conference="AFC";

UPDATE league SET conference ="National Football Conference" Where conference="NFC";

SELECT * FROM league;
id|conference
1|American Football Conference
2|National Football Conference





	Display the information in both tables using one query.


SELECT * FROM teams, league WHERE teams.league_id = league.id;

id|name|city|roster_size|made_playoffs|league_id|id|conference
1|Eagles|Philadelphia|90|false|2|2|National Football Conference
2|Redskins|Washington|86|true|2|2|National Football Conference
3|Bills|Buffalo|93|false|1|1|American Football Conference
4|Patriots|New England|89|true|1|1|American Football Conference
5|Giants|New York|91|false|2|2|National Football Conference
6|Panthers|Charlotte|88|true|1|1|American Football Conference



	Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

SELECT teams.city, teams.name, league.conference FROM teams JOIN league WHERE teams.league_id = league.id;

city|name|conference
Philadelphia|Eagles|National Football Conference
Washington|Redskins|National Football Conference
Buffalo|Bills|American Football Conference
New England|Patriots|American Football Conference
New York|Giants|National Football Conference
Charlotte|Panthers|American Football Conference	




	Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

DELETE FROM teams WHERE made_playoffs = "false";

SELECT * FROM teams;

id|name|city|roster_size|made_playoffs|league_id
2|Redskins|Washington|86|true|2
4|Patriots|New England|89|true|1
6|Panthers|Charlotte|88|true|1


	Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

SELECT name, conference FROM teams INNER JOIN league ON teams.league_id = league.id;

name|conference
Redskins|National Football Conference
Patriots|American Football Conference
Panthers|American Football Conference


SELECT name, city, conference FROM teams LEFT JOIN league ON teams.league_id = league.id;

name|city|conference
Redskins|Washington|National Football Conference
Patriots|New England|American Football Conference
Panthers|Charlotte|American Football Conference

SELECT name, city, roster_size, conference FROM teams LEFT JOIN league ON teams.league_id = league.id WHERE roster_size > 87;

name|city|roster_size|conference
Patriots|New England|89|American Football Conference
Panthers|Charlotte|88|American Football Conference
